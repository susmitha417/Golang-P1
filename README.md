## Files and Functionalities

### 1. `main.go`

The `main.go` file is the entry point of the project, where various functionalities are demonstrated by calling functions from different packages.

#### Key Functionalities:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using the `calci` package.
- **Loops and Input**: Takes student marks as input and evaluates their grades using the `loops` package.
- **Structs**: Demonstrates the creation and usage of nested structs (`Name` and `Address`) from the `structures` package.
- **Array**: Demonstrates taking input for student scores and printing them using the `array` package.
- **Methods**: Defines a `Rectangle` struct and calculates its area using methods from the `methods` package.
- **Maps**: Displays a map of countries and their codes using the `maps` package.

### 2. `calci.go`

This file contains the `Asmd` function, which performs basic arithmetic operations on two integers.

#### Code:
```go
package calci

// Asmd performs four arithmetic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) on two integers
func Asmd(a, b int) (int, int, int, int) { 
	return a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b
}
```

#### Key Concept:
- **Functions**: The `Asmd` function takes two integers and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

### 3. `loops.go`

This file defines functions to take student marks as input, check their grades, and provide feedback based on their marks.

#### Code:
```go
package loops

import "fmt"

// StudentMarks takes input for student marks and checks grades
func StudentMarks() {
	var student1, student2, student3, student4 int

	// Taking input from the user for 4 students' marks
	fmt.Println("Enter marks for Student 1:")
	fmt.Scan(&student1)
	// Repeat for other students...
}
```

#### Key Concept:
- **Loops and Input**: Using a loop to take marks as input and `if-else` conditions to assign grades based on the marks.
- **Memory Address**: Prints the memory address of each student's marks.

### 4. `array.go`

This file demonstrates how to work with arrays by taking student marks as input and printing them.

#### Code:
```go
package array

import "fmt"

// Score function takes marks for 5 students and prints them
func Score() {
	var studentScore int
	arr := [5]int{} // Declare an array with 5 integer elements, initialized to 0

	// Taking input for the array
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("Enter marks for student %d: ", i+1)
		fmt.Scan(&studentScore)
		arr[i] = studentScore // Store the input in the array
	}

	// Printing student scores
	fmt.Println("\nStudent Scores:")
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("Student %d: %d\n", i+1, arr[i])
	}
}
```

#### Key Concept:
- **Arrays**: This file demonstrates how to take input for an array of fixed size (5 in this case) and print the values.

### 5. `maps.go`

This file demonstrates how to use a map to store country codes and names, and then print them.

#### Code:
```go
package maps

import "fmt"

// PrintMap prints all key-value pairs in a given map
func PrintMap(m map[string]string) {
	for key, value := range m {
		fmt.Println(key, "->", value)
	}
}
```

#### Key Concept:
- **Maps**: This file demonstrates the use of key-value pairs (map) in Go and iterating through them.

### 6. `methods.go`

This file demonstrates how to define methods for structs, specifically for calculating the area of a rectangle.

#### Code:
```go
package methods

import "fmt"

// Rectangle struct with Width and Height properties
type Rectangle struct {
	Width, Height float64
}

// Method to calculate the area of the rectangle
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
	return r.Width * r.Height
}

// Method to display rectangle details
func (r Rectangle) Display() {
	fmt.Printf("Rectangle [Width: %.2f, Height: %.2f, Area: %.2f]\n", r.Width, r.Height, r.Area())
}
```

#### Key Concept:
- **Methods**: This file demonstrates the concept of methods associated with a struct (i.e., `Rectangle`) and how they can be used to perform actions like calculating the area and displaying the details.

### 7. `structures.go`

This file demonstrates how to use nested structs in Go. It defines a `Name` struct and an `Address` struct that contains a `Name` struct as a field.

#### Code:
```go
package structures

import "fmt"

// Name struct with First and Last name fields
type Name struct {
	Fname string
	Lname string
}

// Address struct with Flat, Residence, and a Name field (nested struct)
type Address struct {
	Flat      int
	Residence string
	Name      Name
}

// DisplayAddress function to print address details
func DisplayAddress(address Address) {
	fmt.Println("Address Details:")
	fmt.Printf("Plot: %d, Residence: %s\n", address.Flat, address.Residence)
	fmt.Printf("Name: %s %s\n", address.Name.Fname, address.Name.Lname)
}
```

Goroutines
Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They allow functions or methods to run concurrently.
You create a goroutine using the go keyword before calling a function.
Syntax:

go
Copy
Edit
go functionName()
This will start the function functionName as a separate goroutine, running concurrently with the rest of the program.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Goroutine!")
}

func main() {
    go sayHello()  // Start sayHello function as a goroutine

    // Allow goroutine to complete before exiting main function
    fmt.Scanln()  // Block the main function until Enter is pressed
}
Explanation:
The go sayHello() line launches the sayHello function as a goroutine, so the main function continues executing concurrently.
To prevent the program from exiting immediately (before the goroutine can finish its work), we use fmt.Scanln() to block the main goroutine, allowing the sayHello function to finish.
2. Channels
Channels provide a way for goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution. A channel is used to send and receive values between goroutines. Channels are typed, meaning they can carry only one type of data (e.g., chan int, chan string).

Syntax to create a channel:

go
Copy
Edit
ch := make(chan int)  // Creates an unbuffered channel of type int
Sending Data to a Channel:

go
Copy
Edit
ch <- value  // Send data to channel ch
Receiving Data from a Channel:

go
Copy
Edit
value := <-ch  // Receive data from channel ch
Example:

go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func add(a, b int, ch chan int) {
    result := a + b
    ch <- result  // Send result to the channel
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)  // Create a channel

    go add(3, 4, ch)  // Launch add function as a goroutine

    result := <-ch  // Receive result from the channel
    fmt.Println("Result from goroutine:", result)
}
Explanation:
We create a channel ch to communicate between the main goroutine and the goroutine add.
The add function calculates the sum and sends the result to the channel ch.
The main function waits for the result from the channel and prints it.

Channels come in two types: Buffered Channels and Unbuffered Channels. 

1. Unbuffered Channels
An unbuffered channel is a channel with no capacity to hold data. When a value is sent on an unbuffered channel, the sending goroutine is blocked until another goroutine receives that value. Similarly, if a goroutine tries to receive from an unbuffered channel but no value has been sent, the receiver is blocked until a value is sent.

Behavior: Blocking occurs on both the sending and receiving side.
Use case: Used when you want to ensure synchronization between goroutines, meaning the sender waits for the receiver to be ready before sending the data and vice versa.
Syntax to create an unbuffered channel:
go
Copy
Edit
ch := make(chan int)  // Creates an unbuffered channel of type int
Example of Unbuffered Channel:
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)  // Unbuffered channel

    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Sending value 42")
        ch <- 42  // Send value to channel (this will block until received)
        fmt.Println("Sent value 42")
    }()

    fmt.Println("Receiving value from channel")
    val := <-ch  // Receive value (this will block until data is sent)
    fmt.Println("Received value:", val)
}
Explanation:
In this example, the sender goroutine will be blocked on ch <- 42 until the main goroutine receives the value using <-ch.
Similarly, the receiver will be blocked until the sender sends the value.
2. Buffered Channels
A buffered channel has a capacity to hold a certain number of values before blocking the sender. The sender will only be blocked when the channel reaches its capacity. Once there is space in the buffer (i.e., the receiver takes a value), the sender can continue sending values. The receiver can also receive values from the channel without blocking until there is data in the channel.

Behavior: The sender can send data into the channel without blocking until the buffer is full.
Use case: Buffered channels are useful when you want to decouple the sender and receiver, allowing the sender to continue working even if the receiver is not immediately available (up to the buffer's capacity).
Syntax to create a buffered channel:
go
Copy
Edit
ch := make(chan int, 2)  // Creates a buffered channel with capacity of 2
Example of Buffered Channel:
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int, 2)  // Buffered channel with capacity 2

    // Send values into the channel without blocking
    ch <- 10  // Sent into the buffer
    ch <- 20  // Sent into the buffer

    // At this point, the buffer is full. Any further sends would block.

    fmt.Println("Receiving values from channel:")
    fmt.Println(<-ch)  // Received 10
    fmt.Println(<-ch)  // Received 20
}
Explanation:
The buffered channel can hold 2 values before blocking the sender.
In the example, the first two ch <- operations send values into the channel without blocking because the buffer has space for two values.
The receiver can then receive the values from the channel, and the sender can continue sending once space becomes available in the buffer.
Key Differences:
Feature	Unbuffered Channel	Buffered Channel
Capacity	No capacity (i.e., it cannot hold any data until a receiver is ready)	Has a fixed capacity (can hold a number of items before blocking)
Blocking Behavior	Blocks both sender and receiver until data is received/sent	Sender blocks only when the buffer is full; receiver blocks only when the buffer is empty
Use Case	Used when strict synchronization is required between sender and receiver	Used when you want to allow some flexibility in sending and receiving data concurrently
Performance	May have more synchronization overhead because both sides block until data is received/sent	Allows sending data into the channel without blocking until the buffer is full, improving performance for certain use cases
When to Use Which?
Use an Unbuffered Channel when:

You want strict synchronization between sender and receiver.
The communication between the goroutines should happen immediately (sender waits for receiver and vice versa).
Typically used when you need to guarantee that the sender and receiver are synchronized at the exact moment of communication.
Use a Buffered Channel when:

You want the sender to be able to send data without waiting for the receiver immediately (up to the buffer's capacity).
You need to decouple the sender and receiver, allowing the sender to continue working even if the receiver hasn't processed the previous messages yet.
Often used in cases where the sender produces data at a different rate than the receiver can consume.
Example with Both Buffered and Unbuffered Channels:
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Unbuffered channel example
    unbufferedCh := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        unbufferedCh <- 1  // This will block until received
        fmt.Println("Sent 1 to unbuffered channel")
    }()
    fmt.Println(<-unbufferedCh)  // This will unblock the sender
    // Output: Sent 1 to unbuffered channel

    // Buffered channel example
    bufferedCh := make(chan int, 2)
    bufferedCh <- 1  // No blocking
    bufferedCh <- 2  // No blocking
    fmt.Println(<-bufferedCh)  // Receive 1
    fmt.Println(<-bufferedCh)  // Receive 2
}
Summary:
Unbuffered channels block both the sender and receiver until data is exchanged.
Buffered channels allow the sender to send multiple values without blocking until the buffer is full.
